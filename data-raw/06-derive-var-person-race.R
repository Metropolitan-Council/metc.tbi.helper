# Race is a select-all question, but it helps to have a single column sometimes for factor-type analysis.
# This table adds a column for "race_ethnicity_simple" that categorizes people according to the
# race/ethnicity they selected, with an option for "2 or more races" for those that tick more than one box.

# Note, we should really go through the "other_specify" column (not included in this data extract)
# to weed out the (presumably) white people who answer as "human race", "none of your business" etc :/
