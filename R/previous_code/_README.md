This folder contains scripts that were written prior to the data.table
conversion and prior to updates made to the data itself.

### Todo:

1.  Verify scripts still run with updated data source

2.  Convert to data.table where appropriate

3.  Add created graphic, table, or statistic to TBI2021WhitePaper.Rmd

4.  Migrate updated/verified script out of the previous_code folder into
    the R folder

5.  Remove scripts with no clear use case
